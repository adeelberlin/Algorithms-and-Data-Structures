# Algorithms and Data Structures 2017-18
This respository contains all the labs and courseworks which I did for my algorithms and data structures module at university. The respository contains code written in Java and c++. In this module I improved my problem solving skills as well as learning about different algorithms and data structures.

# What I learnt in this module:
  - Java
  - Problem Solving
  - Data Structures
  - Algorithms
